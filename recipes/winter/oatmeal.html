                <ul class="list">
                    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>11 cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
                    <li>1 cup raisins</li>

            <h1 class="wintertitle2">Instructions</h1>
            <div class="winterinstructions2">
                <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
                    <p class="steps"> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, which takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, mixing well after each addition.

</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon, and salt.


</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, and mix until just combined.
</p>
                <h3>Step 6: Add Oats and Raisins</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Stir in the rolled oats and raisins until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
</p>
                <h3>Step 7: Scoop Cookie Dough</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Use a spoon or cookie scoop to drop portions of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between them, as the cookies will spread during baking</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Flatten Slightly (Optional)</h3>
                    <p class="steps">If you prefer thinner cookies, you can gently flatten the dough portions with the back of a fork.</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown, but the centers are still slightly soft. Be careful not to overbake; the cookies will continue to set as they cool.</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Cool</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely</p>
