                <ul class="list">
                    <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

            <div class="winterinstructions2">
                <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
                    <p class="steps"> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Whisk Dry Ingredients</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Set this dry mixture aside.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, which takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, mixing well after each addition</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Mix in the Dry Ingredients</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</p>
                <h3>Step 6: Chill the Dough (Optional)</h3>
                    <p class="steps">The dough can be a bit sticky. If it’s too soft to work with, you can cover the bowl and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to an hour to make it easier to handle.</p>
                <h3>Step 7: Prepare Cinnamon-Sugar Coating</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a small bowl, mix together the 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon.</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Form Cookie Dough Balls</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Scoop out portions of the cookie dough, about 1 to 1.5 tablespoons each, and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar coating to cover it completely.</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Place on Baking Sheets</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Place the coated cookie dough balls on the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between them to allow for spreading.</p>
                <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges are slightly golden but the centers are still soft. Be careful not to overbake; the cookies will continue to set as they cool.
                <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
