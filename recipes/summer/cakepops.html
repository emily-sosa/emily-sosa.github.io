                <h3>For Cake:</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>1 box of your favorite cake mix (plus the ingredients required on the box, typically eggs, water, and oil)</li>
                    <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Assembling and Decorating:</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Frosting mixture with the same or similar flavor of cake flavor</li>
                    <li>Candy melts or chocolate wafers (of your choice)</li>
                    <li>Lollipop sticks</li>
                    <li>Sprinkles, crushed cookies, or other decorations</li>
                    <li>Styrofoam block or cake pop stand (for drying)</li>
                </ul>

            <h1 class="summertitle2">Instructions</h1>
            <div class="summerinstructions2">
                <h3>Step 1: Preheat Oven</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Preheat your oven according to the cake mix instructions.
</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Prepare Cake Batter</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Prepare the cake mix according to the instructions on the box, which typically involve mixing it with eggs, water, and oil. Bake the cake in a greased 9x13-inch pan or as directed on the box.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3: Crumble</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Once the cake is baked and has cooled completely, crumble it into fine crumbs in a large mixing bowl.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 4: Forming Cake Pops</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Take small portions of the cake and frosting mixture and roll them into 1-1.5 inch diameter cake balls. Place them on a lined baking sheet.

                    Insert a lollipop stick into each cake ball, about halfway through. This will be easier if you dip the tip of the stick into candy melts or chocolate before inserting it.

                    Once all the cake pops are assembled, refrigerate them for about 30 minutes to firm up.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 5: Dipping Cake Pops</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Melt your candy melts or chocolate wafers in a microwave-safe bowl, following the package instructions. Melt one color at a time, and use a deep enough bowl to easily dip the cake pops.

                    Dip each cake pop into the melted candy melts or chocolate, allowing any excess to drip off. You can gently tap the stick to remove the excess coating.

                    While the coating is still wet, you can add sprinkles or other decorations if desired.

                    Stick the cake pops into a Styrofoam block or cake pop stand to let them dry and set.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 6: Finishing Touches</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Once the coating has hardened, your cake pops are ready to enjoy! You can store them in an airtight container or display them on a cake pop stand.
                    Cake pops make fun and delicious treats for parties or as gifts. You can get creative with different cake and frosting combinations, as well as decorating ideas to suit various occasions.</p>
