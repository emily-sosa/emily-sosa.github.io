                <ul class="list">
                    <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
                    <li>5 cups water</li>
                    <li>1 cinnamon stick (or 1-2 teaspoons ground cinnamon)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 cups milk (you can use whole milk, almond milk, or any milk of your choice)</li>
                    <li>Ground cinnamon for garnish (optional)</li>  
                </ul>

            <h1 class="springtitle2">Instructions</h1>
            <div class="instructions2">
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 1: Rinse the Rice</h3>
                    <p class="steps"> Place the white rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it thoroughly under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the horchata from becoming too thick.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 2:Blend the Rice and Cinnamon</h3>
                    <p class="steps">In a blender, combine the rinsed rice, 2 cups of water, and the cinnamon stick (or ground cinnamon). Blend on high for a couple of minutes until the rice and cinnamon are well ground, and the mixture is smooth.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 3: Add More Water</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Pour the rice mixture into a large pitcher and add the remaining 3 cups of water. Stir well to combine.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 4: Let It Soak</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Cover the pitcher and let the mixture sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or you can leave it overnight. Allowing the rice to soak will help the flavors meld.

</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 5: Strain the Mixture</h3>
                    <p class="steps">After the soaking period, strain the rice mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, cheesecloth, or a nut milk bag into a separate pitcher or bowl. This will remove the rice solids and cinnamon pieces. Use a spoon to press down on the solids to extract all the liquid.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 6: Sweeten and Flavor</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract to the strained liquid. Stir well until the sugar is completely dissolved. Taste the horchata and adjust the sweetness to your liking by adding more sugar if needed.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 7: Add Milk</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Pour in the milk of your choice and stir until well combined. Whole milk is traditional, but you can use almond milk or any other milk alternative if you prefer.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 8: Chill</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Cover the horchata and refrigerate it until well chilled, usually for a few hours or overnight. The flavors will continue to meld during this time.</p>
                <h3 class="springsubtitle">Step 9: Serve</h3>
                    <p class="steps">Stir the horchata before serving. You can serve it over ice and garnish with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon if desired.</p>
